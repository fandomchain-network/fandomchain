FandomChain is the L1 blockchain dedicated to streamers.

The idea is simple: each streamer can create a token linked to their stream — one token per stream — to monetize their audience and diversify their revenue streams.

Meanwhile, fans can finally support their favorite creators in a direct and transparent way.
